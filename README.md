# String Manipulation

## Instructions

In this lab you'll be practicing manipulating strings.

1. In encoder.js create a method that will take a string and apply methods from the String class to it to make the original meaning of the string difficult to discern.

2. In decoder.js create a program that will take that mutated string from encoder.js and will return it to its original configuration, making the meaning of the string clear again.
